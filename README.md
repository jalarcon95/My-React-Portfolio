## [Description](#table-of-contents)

This project is an interactive portfolio created using React. It is designed to share my projects, resume, and skills with potential employers. React is a modern, interactive framework that allows developers to create dynamic appliations with multi-page functionality through the component structure. To this day, React is one of the most widely used libraries in Javascript.

## [Installation](#table-of-contents)

- Initial file structure was created with [Create-React-App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).
- Styling, icons, and UI created using [Material-UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/).
- Developers can run 'npm install' on their machine to download all necessary packages after cloning this repository.
- Deployed using gh-pages.


## [Usage](#table-of-contents)

Through the use of components with React, the app presents a multi-page experience where the user is able to flip through the 'pages' by clicking the tabs on the navbar(header). The footer contains links (icons) to my github, linkedin, and my email. The footer and header are present on all 'pages'. The 4 'pages' are 'About, Portfolio, Resume, and Contact'. The 'About' page contains a photo and some background information about myself. The 'Portfolio' page contains a list of some of my latest projects, along with links (buttons) that direct the user to the live link or corresponding github repository. The 'Resume' page contains a link(button) to my resume for the user to download as well as a list of some front-end and back-end technologies that I have worked with. Lastly, the 'Contact' page provides a form for the user to leave a name, email, and a message; along with a submit button to send me a message. At the point in time, the application only has front-end functionality and would require adding some backend framework for users to be able to contact me via the contact form.
